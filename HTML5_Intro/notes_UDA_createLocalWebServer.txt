In the previous morsel, we received the following error message because we weren't directly hosting the images we wanted to display.

Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to execute 'toDataURL' on
'HTMLCanvasElement': Tainted canvases may not be exported.

There are couple of ways to get around this error and one (optionally) is to start a local web server.
Using Python SimpleHTTPServer

The simplest way is to use SimpleHTTPServer if you already have Python installed.

Python comes already installed on most Mac OS X and Linux computers. In a terminal window, change to the directory that has your HTML files and run the following command:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

After it starts, you can navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html
Using MAMP / MAMP Pro

MAMP is an integrated server environment containing executables for running a web server, a database, and several programming languages. MAMP stands for Mac OS X, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python. Though it was originally developed for the Mac, there are versions that run on Windows.

After installing MAMP, open it and start the server.

Go to settings and set the directory to where you have saved your HTML files.

Navigate to http://localhost:8888/MAMP/index.html
